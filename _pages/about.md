## Scientific exploration

My background spans Applied Physics (specializing in quantum technology), Applied Mathematics, and New Media Art. I’m especially fascinated by nanotechnology, quantum sensing/computing, computational physics and emergent phenomena.  During my studies I did research projects at <a href="https://www.asml.com/en" target="_blank">ASML</a>, the <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT Media Lab</a>  and <a href="https://qutech.nl/" target="_blank">Qutech</a>, whose topics ranged from optics, spintronics to topological quantum computation. 

Currently, I’m a trainee at <a href="https://www.tno.nl/en/" target="_blank">TNO</a>, the Dutch Organization for Applied Scientific Research, where I explore different roles within an institute that turns scientific insights into real-world impact.

## Artistic practice

Alongside research, I pursue an artistic practice where I try to show the beauty of science to inspire curiosity and connection, aiming to make complex topics feel more accessible. For example, my recent piece <i>"Ode to the Fast Fourier Transform"</i> is a visual tribute to the algorithm that quietly powers so much of the technology we use every day.

While at university, I co-founded student team <a href="https://www.emergencedelft.nl/" target="_blank">Emergence Delft</a> to confront the growing <b>blackboxing of technology</b>, where technology's increasing complexity is making it less transparent. As a result, people lose touch with the underlying principles shaping the tools they use every day, making it harder to reflect and engage with them critically. 

> The way scientific and technical work is made invisible by its own success. When a machine runs efficiently, when a matter of fact is settled, one need focus only on its inputs and outputs and not on its internal complexity. Thus, paradoxically, the more science and technology succeed, the more opaque and obscure they become. - Bruno Latour

As the first team's R&D manager, I led the development of the installation <a href="https://www.emergencedelft.nl/about-us/newmediaproject" target="_blank"><i>"Unseen Echoes"</i></a> which was exhibited at the Highlight Delft festival in Feb. 2024. In this artwork, the invisibility of fake accounts on social media are related to the invisibility of infra-red light. 

At Emergence Delft, I continue to be involved as the treasurer on the foundation’s board.
