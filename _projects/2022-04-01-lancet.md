V.D.G. Lancet is the largest cultural student association in the Netherlands. For its more than 1200 members it organizes a wide range of activities to let their cultural interests flourish. Next to my work as treasurer of the 70th annual board I created the works Tunnel Visions and Red Dressed, turned the association's logo into a Neon LED sign and used it as inspiration for the album cover of our anniversary record.

​The slogan of our board is “Avant-garde”, over which is said: “The avant-garde pushes the boundaries of what is accepted as the norm or the status quo.” Together with Angela Hanna, I designed a T-shirt about our slogan, visualised by a person trying to get out of its confining box. Some elements were changed into a single boundary by tranforming the images into a travelling salesman problem and solving them. 

Red Dressed was a temporary interactive installation on the campus of the Delft University of Technology. It was was made in close collaboration with Lisanne Fung Fen Chung and used to promote the cultural student association Lancet among first year students. In the installation a camera is hidden that automatically, using facial recognition, snaps a picture of your face. Subsequently a receipt is printed with information about the association and a personal "compatibility score". Everyone receives a high score, urging them to join Lancet.

More to come.. Work in progress.
