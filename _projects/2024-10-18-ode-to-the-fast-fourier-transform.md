​The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is a widely used algorithm in digital signal processing that revolutionized the way signals are analyzed and processed. It was developed in the 1960s and has since become an essential tool for a wide range of applications in science, and engineering. The FFT is an efficient algorithm for computing the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), a mathematical operation that converts a time-domain signal into its frequency-domain representation to reveal the frequency components that compose the signal.

The impact of the FFT has been immense. It has enabled the development of a wide range of applications, including digital audio processing, image processing, data compression, and telecommunications, to name just a few. It is an illustration of the power of mathematics and its ability to transform the way we understand and manipulate signals.

I am interested in how the FFT unveils hidden harmonies. How this tool offers us a new way to perceive, changing our perspective on the raw data of our world. How it mediates between two different realms, uncovering some of their secrets and symmetries. The FFT ignites my imagination both scientifically and artistically. This is why, in homage to this tool, I have created this work. For which I developed a fading algorithm that leverages the power of the FFT to blend pictures and their Fourier Transforms. I use it to explore new ways of artistic expression to make the hidden and complex digital world around us visible. ​

For the KunstParade exhibition at Museum Prinsenhof Delft I created a diptych, on view from 18 Oktober 2024 untill 5 January 2025. The result is a contemporary interpretation of stained glass windows in which form and color merge and evaporate in waves.
